# pythonFileSimulator
A python programmed file simulator repository. 

Code solely created and published by: Harsh Patel

The following are the features of my completed assignment project:
- Displays current working directory.
- Allows end user input mode with some exceptions.
- 'ls' command lists all the contents in the present working directory along with showing current directory path.
- Command 'touch' with multiple arguments creates files with the names provided as arguments.
- Command 'mkdir' with one argument creates a directory with name given as an argument.
- Command 'cd' helps navigating through the whole file system with flexibility to move back and forth.

Instructions to run and test project:
1. Copy and paste the code to a text file and save it as {fileName}.py file.
2. Open terminal or cmd in the same folder and run command python {fileName}.py.
3. It will turn to /root> and prompting for a command, if ran successfully.
4. Command 'ls' will run successfully, if only ran as it is without any arguments because there is no feature to list contents of another directory, for now.
5. Command 'mkdir' will run successfully, if only ran with 1 argument, all other arguments will be ignored. It will throw an error to have required argument if none are provided, for now.
6. Command 'touch' will run successfully, if only ran with atleast 1 argument. It will throw an error to have required arguments if none are provided, for now.
7. Command 'cd' will run successfully, if only ran with 1 argument, all other arguments will be ignored. If you use only "cd .." command then only it will move back to previous directory. It will throw an error to have required argument if none are provided, for now.
8. Command 'exit' will end the program and returns to OS by discarding all memory held by program.
